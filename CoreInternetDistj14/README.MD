Four web pages has been created for this assignment.

SignIn, SignUp, AboutMe and Gallery.cshtml

The proejct has been created using dotnet core.

A rather small css file has been created under wwwroot->css->site.css

A small javascript file has been created in wwwroot->js->pwChecker.js
	The purpose of this file is to check the clients input from the client side.
	The reason being there is no need to make a call to the server if the data can
	be checked on the client side. The data still needs to be checked on the server
	side when the backend is created.
